# PrepCourse | [CODELEX](https://codelex.io)

## Prerequisites

Most likely you will need a [Github account](https://github.com/join), Github is like a Dropbox for developers where code is shared.

There are two options how to work on exercises, you must choose **ONE** of them.

### Option #1 -> Code directly in your browser

Easiest way to get started is to use [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io) it is basically a coding environment in the cloud, you **DO NOT** have to install anything locally.

üö® There is a 50 hour per month limit on Gitpod after which you need to start to pay, if you reach the limit you can either pay or just jump to `option #2` and set up everything locally.

Each exercise will have a link for opening it on Gitpot.

Choose this option if:

- you don't want to install anything on your computer
- your computer is old & slow
- you are not a confident computer user (will mess something up when installing things)

### Option #2 -> Install everything locally

[‚û°Ô∏è Follow this link for detailed instructions](./work-station-setup.md)

Choose this option if:

- you are comfortable with installing things
